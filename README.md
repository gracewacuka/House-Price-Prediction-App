🏠 Project Description

The House Price Prediction App is a machine learning web application designed to estimate the price of a house based on key property features. Users can input details such as the area (in square feet), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and available parking spaces, and the app will instantly generate an estimated price.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can be applied to real world problems in the housing market. The predictive model was trained using historical housing data where relationships between various property attributes and prices were analyzed to build an accurate regression model.

The app is built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive, interactive and user-friendly interface that allows users to test different property configurations and view instant predictions. The backend model is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and Scikit-learn, ensuring reliable and efficient computation.

This project is ideal for showcasing practical machine learning deployment — from data preprocessing and model training to integration within a live web application.
